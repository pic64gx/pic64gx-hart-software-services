  The Flash_init() function initializes the MSS QSPI and the flash memory to
  normal SPI operations. The g_qspi_config.io_format is used for the read/write
  operations to choose the Flash memory commands accordingly.
  This function must be called before calling any other function provided by
  this driver.

  The Winbondw25n01gv device expects the command-address bytes on DQ0 always.
  Hence the only MSS QSPI IO formats that can be used are MSS_QSPI_NORMAL,
  MSS_QSPI_DUAL_EX_RO, MSS_QSPI_QUAD_EX_RO.

  Furthermore, the DUAL operations are not supported by the flash program
  commands (Flash read supports dual and quad IOs).
  When dual operations are selected the programming operations will fall-back
  to normal mode. Reads will happen on quad IO.

  It is recommended that QUAD mode is selected for faster operations.

  @param io_format
  The io_format parameter provides the SPI IO format that needs to be used for
  read/write operations.

  @return
    This function does not returns any value

  The Flash_scan_for_bad_blocks() function scans for bad blocks within the flash
  memory. The NAND flash devices are allowed to be shipped with certain number of
  bad blocks. In such cases, the flash device is shipped with bad blocks markers
  written into the respective bad blocks. The markers will be permanently lost
  if the block is written or erased. This function can be called on a unused
  device to know the factory marked bad blocks before erasing or writing on those
  block. The bad blocks can then be re-mapped to good blocks by adding a bad
  block (lba) to good block (pba) mapping in the lookup table (LUT) within the
  flash memory using the Flash_add_entry_to_bb_lut() function. Maximum 20 entries
  are allowed in the lookup table in the W25N01 devices. Only the first block of
  the shipped device is guaranteed to be a good block.

  Bad blocks can also be developed during the regular usage of the flash memory
  device. These should be handled as and when errors happen during program/erase
  operations and the LUT should be updated accordingly.

  @param buf
  The buf parameter is a pointer to the buffer in which the driver will
  write the block numbers of the blocks containing the bad-block marker. The
  buffer must be larg enough to contain 20 block numbers.

  @return
    This function returns the total number of bad blocks found during the scan.

  ( using Flash_scan_for_bad_blocks() function) or when a bad block is found
  during regular operation (indicated by errors during programming or erase
  operation), this function can be used to map these bad block to a good block
  where no errors are seen so far.

  After the LUT entry is added, any access to the bad block will be directed to
  the mapped good block. The bad block will not be accessed.

  @param lba
  The lba parameter is the block number of the bad block.

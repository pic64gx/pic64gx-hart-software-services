        help
		The timeout for entering the TinyCLI (in seconds). When CONFIG_TINYCLI is enabled,
                the HSS will wait for a keypress for this timeout before continuing with its boot
                process.

                If a key press (other than ESC) is detected, the HSS will enter the TINYCLI mode,
                which allows interactive running of a small number of commands. Typing `HELP` at
                the TINYCLI prompt lists the supported commands.
